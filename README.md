# Dynamic Landing of Quadcopter on Moving Platform

This repository contains the simulation and implementation details of a dynamic landing control system for the Parrot Mambo Minidrone.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
Using MATLAB Simulink and Simscape, we developed a digital twin model to simulate and test autonomous drone landings on a moving platform. The real-world implementation involved a line-following robot carrying the platform and an onboard vision system.
